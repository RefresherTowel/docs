*Turn raw numbers into reactions!*

**Catalyst** is a feature-rich yet easy to use **stats and modifiers** framework for GameMaker. It treats stats as *living systems*, not dead numbers on a sheet, and lets you think of them more like ingredients in a chemistry set.

Base stats, gear, buffs, debuffs, kill counts, weather, and story flags can all bubble together into things like crit chances, damage types, and special rules. You describe how those reactions work once, then plug in new ideas as you go, without tearing up the rest of your game every time you decide the numbers should do something new.

Catalyst is part of the upcoming **RefresherTowel Games** suite of reusable frameworks for GameMaker. While not yet available, it will be coming soon. Every framework in the suite will ship with extensive docs and full Feather integration to keep them easy to drop into your projects.
