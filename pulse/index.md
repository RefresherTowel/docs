**Pulse** is a lightweight **signals and events** framework for GameMaker that helps keep your game in sync. It gives you a clean way to broadcast events and let any number of listeners react, without wiring everything together by hand.

Pulse is part of the upcoming **RefresherTowel Games** suite of reusable frameworks for GameMaker. While not yet available, it will be coming soon. Every framework in the suite will ship with extensive docs and full Feather integration to keep them easy to drop into your projects.
