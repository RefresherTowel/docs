# Pulse

*The beating heart of your game!*

**Pulse** is a lightweight, reusable **signal and event system** for GameMaker.  

Designed to be dropped directly into any project and used immediately, with only a few lines of code.

Pulse is part of the **RefresherTowel Games** suite of reusable frameworks for GameMaker. All of my
frameworks come with extensive documentation and complete integration with Feather to make using them as 
easy as possible.

Pulse gives you:

- A signal controller you can access from anywhere (global `PULSE`), **or** custom controllers you can instantiate for isolated buses.
- Simple **subscribe / send** helpers for day-to-day use.
- Optional **builder-based configuration** for advanced listeners.
- Built-in support for **one-shot listeners**, **sender filters**, **tags**, **priorities**, and **cancellation**.
- Both **immediate** and **queued** dispatch modes.
- Handy **introspection utilities** for debugging and profiling.
- Weak-ref subscribers keep the system lean: stale listeners are pruned automatically as you dispatch.

---

## Introduction

Pulse replaces scattered "call this script if X happens" patterns with a small, focused signal layer:

- You define **signal identifiers** (usually macros, enums or plain strings, if you're daring).
- Things **subscribe** to the signals they care about.
- Anywhere in your project can **send** or **post** those signals.
- Pulse fans signals out to all matching listeners, in priority order, until the event is optionally consumed.
- Pulse uses weak references for its subscribers, so controller structs and instances won't be kept alive just because they're listening on the bus. Dead listeners are automatically pruned as you dispatch signals, keeping the system lean without you having to remember to unsubscribe from every corner of your code.

You can keep things **very simple** (just `PulseSubscribe` + `PulseSend`) or layer on more advanced features as your project grows.

## Basic Features (Core)

These are the features most users will interact with day-to-day:

- **Global signal bus**  
  Pulse exposes a single global controller via the `PULSE` macro. You do not need to create or manage a controller yourself.

- **Simple subscribe / send API**  
  - `PulseSubscribe(id, signal, callback, [from])`  
  - `PulseSubscribeOnce(id, signal, callback, [from])`  
  - `PulseSend(signal, [data], [from])`  
  - All of these are also available as methods on a `PulseController` instance if you want your own bus.

- **Simple cleanup helpers**  
  - `PulseUnsubscribe(id, signal, [from], [tag])`  
  - `PulseRemove(id)` for bulk removal (for example, in Destroy events).  
  - Weak references mean Pulse will try to prune dead listeners automatically, but explicit cleanup is still recommended in state/room transitions.

- **Sender filtering (`from`)**  
  Listeners can choose to only react to events from a specific sender id, or use `noone` to accept events from anyone.

- **One-shot listeners**  
  Use `PulseSubscribeOnce` when you want a listener that automatically unsubscribes itself after the first matching event. Perfect for hooking one time tutorial popups into your project.

- **Feather-friendly**  
  Functions are fully annotated with JSDoc-style comments for better autocompletion and linting in GameMaker's code editor.

If you are a beginner or just need straightforward messaging, you can safely stop at these features.

## Advanced Features

These features are optional. You only need them if your project calls for more control or introspection.

- **Builder-based configuration**  
  - `PulseListener(id, signal, callback)` creates a listener config struct.  
  - Chain `.From()`, `.Once()`, `.Tag()`, `.Priority()` to customise it.  
  - Call `.Subscribe()` or `PulseSubscribeConfig(listener)` to register it. You can point a builder at a custom bus via `.Bus(my_bus)` or use `my_bus.Listener(...)`.

- **Subscription groups**  
  - `PulseGroup()` collects multiple subscription handles and lets you `UnsubscribeAll()`/`Destroy()` them together.

- **Tags**  
  Tag listeners (for example `TAG_RUNE_PROC`, `TAG_UI`, `TAG_DEBUG`) so you can selectively unsubscribe or organise your subscriptions.

- **Priorities**  
  Each listener has a numeric `priority`. Higher values run *earlier*. Useful for things like "core gameplay logic first, VFX last".

- **Cancellation / consumption**  
  A listener can **stop further propagation** of a signal by either:
  - Returning `true` from its callback, or
  - Setting `data.consumed = true` on a struct payload.

- **Queued dispatch**  
  - `PulsePost(signal, [data], [from])` enqueues an event.  
  - `PulseFlushQueue([max_events])` processes queued events later, in FIFO order, using the same rules as `PulseSend`.

- **Introspection utilities**  
  - `PulseCount(signal)` and `PulseCountFor(id)` to inspect listener counts.  
  - `PulseDump()` and `PulseDumpSignal(signal)` to log the current wiring through your debug system.

You can completely ignore these until you actually need them.

## Requirements

- **GameMaker version**  
  Any version that supports:
  - Struct constructors (`function Name(args) constructor { ... }`)
  - Methods (`method(owner, fn)`)
  - Standard array and struct functions used in modern GML

- **Scripts you need**  
  - The Pulse script (containing `ePulseResult`, `PulseListener`, `PulseSubscribe`, `PulseSend`, etc.).  
  - Your debug system script, providing at least:
    - `EchoDebugInfo(message, [tags])`  
    - `EchoDebugWarn(message, [tags])`  
    - `EchoDebugSevere(message, [tags])`  

Pulse uses these debug functions for dumps and warnings. They must exist (even if they are simple wrappers or no-ops in release builds), but Pulse will still work if you choose not to log anything.

No additional extensions or assets are required.

## Quick Start (Core)

A minimal example: one object listening for a signal and another sending it.

```js
// Somewhere in a shared script:
#macro SIG_DAMAGE_TAKEN 0
```

```js
/// obj_player Create
PulseSubscribe(id, SIG_DAMAGE_TAKEN, function(_data) {
    var _amount = is_struct(_data) ? _data.amount : _data;
    hp -= _amount;
});
```

```js
/// obj_enemy: when it hits the player
var _payload = { amount: 5 };
PulseSend(SIG_DAMAGE_TAKEN, _payload, id);
```

That is all you need to get a basic signal flowing through Pulse:

- The player subscribes to `SIG_DAMAGE_TAKEN`.
- The enemy sends that signal with some payload data.
- Pulse calls the player's callback in a `with (id)` context, where `id` is the instance that subscribed, so `self` inside the callback is that instance.
